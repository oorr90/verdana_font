        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Verdana was released in 1996 as a digital font. Designed by Matthew Carter, with the help of Tom Rickner, Verdana was created with scaleable screen sizes in mind, which is why it is still legible on small devices and low-resolution screens. The sans-serif typeface was originally created for the Microsoft Corporation, following increasing demand for versatile digital typefaces.</p>
        <p>The time that Carter and Rickner spent creating Verdana was extremely labor-intensive and thus, expensive. They wanted to ensure that the font could be used in a wide range of languages. The designers also created the characters with every point size from 9 to 60 in mind.</p>

        <h2>Characteristics</h2>
        <p>As a sans-serif font, Verdana lacks serifs and has loose letter spacing, in addition to stark differences between characters to increase legibility. Verdana uses pixels to create clear and legible lettering for all screen sizes. All the letters have a large x-height, which is the distance between the baseline and the mean line of lower-case letters in a typeface. The font weight was also designed to be thicker than other digital fonts at the time of its creation. Unlike earlier typefaces, Verdana was not created with handwriting or print in mind. For this reason, is it unwise to use Verdana in print, as it tends to slow readers down.</p>
        <p>With tall lower-case letters and generous spacing between letters, Verdana is often referred to as one of the most legible fonts of all time. Letters that may have otherwise appeared to be quite similar were designed with care to increase distinction. For example, the uppercase “I” has serifs on the top and bottom. The lowercase letter “i” has a square dot, rather than a circle. The lowercase letter “j” has a serif on top to the left. The number “1” has a horizontal base and a hook up top.</p>
